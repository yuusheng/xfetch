# xfetch

ðŸ¥‡ This repo is dependency free and is written to implement all of the axios APIs.

## ðŸš€ Motivation

Axios is a incredible repo. But sometimes we want to have a lighter way to request our api service. Using fetch is a good way to do that. But fetch api is not so easily to use. You can reference the source code of this repository to write your own code.
