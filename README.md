# xfetch

ðŸ¥‡ This repo is dependency free and is written to implement all of the axios APIs.

## ðŸš€ Motivation

Axios is an incredible repo. But sometimes we want to have a lighter way to request our API service. Using the fetch API is a good way to do that. But the fetch API is not so easy to use. You can reference the source code of this repository to write your own code.
